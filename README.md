# ansible-enos
Ansible modules for Lenovo Enterprise Network Operating System (ENOS)

## Purpose  
- These early modules are based on [Lenovo CNOS Ansible](https://github.com/lenovo/ansible-cnos) modules. I've modified them to work with switches running Lenovo ENOS.
- I hope to eventually create new ENOS modules utilizing SSH or NetCLI rather than paramiko.
- Place these modules in the ./library folder with your playbooks.
